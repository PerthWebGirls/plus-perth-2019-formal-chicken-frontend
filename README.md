Do not work on Master.
'Feature branches' are the flavour of the day.  So please branch.

Pull requests can't be approved until they're reviewed by a peer.
Once approved, the pull request can be manually merged.
... IF there's a merge conflict, please resolve the merge using 'Source Tree' or some something similar which minimises pain.
